# Supervised Learning to classify the Poker Hands.

## Algorithms used : 
` Random Forest , KNeighborsClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier `

## Conclusion: 
- KNeighborsClassifier gave higher accuracy for this dataset which is 63.94%.
- Althogh, OLS is used for Regression, I used it to get the statistics about the independent varibles such as T-test, P-value etc.
- I have Used corr() to find out multi-collinearity between the independent variables but it is advisable to use VIF for that purpose.
- Hyper parameter tuning is necessary to get more accuarcy since the data is discrete and random.
